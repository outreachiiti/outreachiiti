               <hr>
               <h5 class="agenda">Randomness is an important resource in computing. In the blockchain/web3 space, many decentralized finance (DeFi) and particularly gaming applications, such as Lottery, Poker etc. crucially require a good source of randomness.  In this setting generating good randomness is particularly non-trivial -- this is because the typical source of randomness relies on (computation on) private source, and it is notoriously hard to support private computation on blockchain. Therefore, off-chain private sources are used. However, one needs to ensure that the off-chain randomness sources perform the task correctly in order to ensure crucial properties, such as unpredictability, unbiasbaility etc. This leads to a new requirement, namely public verifiability, which guarantees that each randomness can be verified publicly. Typically, this is ensured by deploying a cryptographic object, known as verifiable random functions (VRF). While many existing on-chain VRF services satisfy the crucial requirements mentioned above, they often become too expensive to use. In this talk, I am going to mainly speak about a new design for providing on-chain randomness service, known as FlexiRand, in that we show how we can leverage output privacy of VRFs to ensure a flexible design which enables cost amortization, flexibly. At the same time, I plan to also mention a few on-going works on decentralized Poker, a few plausible vulnerabilities in the existing framework, and some new ideas we have for further improvements.

               <hr>
               <h5 class="agenda">Reconnaissance Blind Chess (RBC) is a variant of Chess in which playerscan only sense a 3 x 3 grid within the 8 x 8 Chess board before they playtheir move. This restriction makes RBC a game of imperfect information, with many new challenges to address. In this talk, I present Fianchetto, our agent that won the NeurIPS 2021 RBC competition by a large margin, and finished runner-up at NeurIPS 2022. Fianchetto builds on the publicly-available code base of StrangeFish (the 2019 winner), and incorporates changes such as a faster board evaluation module, Bayesian belief updating, and incentives for strategic RBC moves. I discuss how elements of our solution may generalise to other games of imperfect information, and outline topics for future research.
